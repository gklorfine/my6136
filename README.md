This GitHub repo provides a template you can use to organize your work
for [Psy6136: Categorical Data
Analysis](https://friendly.github.io/psy6136/) (or any course). It
provides:

- A reasonable organization of folders for your work. Feel free to add
  any others

- Some templates for using Rmarkdown in assignments or projects and also
  for setting up R scripts so you “compile” them with
  [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) to produce output in HTML, DOCX,
  PDF, … The following are provided, just to get you started:

  - [Assignment template](assign/assign-template.R): Simple template for
    using an R script for an assignment. This appears like this in
    [HTML](assign/assign-template.html) when you `knitr` it.
  - [Rmarkdown template](R/RMarkdown-template.Rmd): For a report, with
    more text than code. Code is in R “chunks”
  - [R script template](R/RScript-template.R): For an R script, with
    output rendered to HTML, DOCX, or PDF

## Getting started

I recommend that you set up an [RStudio
project](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects)
for your work in the course, where you can organize your notes and work
on assignments, projects, etc.

This repository on GitHub: [my6136](https://github.com/friendly/my6136)
provides a template for this. You can simply [download the ZIP
file](https://github.com/friendly/my6136/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
to your computer, unzip it, and then open it in RStudio (double-click on
the file `my6136.Rproj`).

### Using GitHub

If you are comfortable using GitHub, you can simply fork & clone this
repo to your own account. Details on this are given in [fork and clone
this repo](https://github.com/rstats-tln/fork-and-clone-repo). The
images below show what’s involved for `my6136`.

If you don’t yet use GitHub, you can easily [create a GitHub
account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github)
(**highly recommended**: Your future self will thank me!)

## Installing packages

You will need a bunch of R packages for this course. The file
[`R/install-vcd-packages.R`](R/install-vcd-packages.R) contains the ones
I recommend. Simply run this in RStudio.

### PDF output

In RStudio, rendering scripts and `.Rmd` files to PDF uses
[`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/) to convert to LaTeX `.tex` files and
then working `LaTeX` installation to convert to PDF. The R package
[tinytex](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) makes this relatively easy.
